The Trouble Ticket subjects "Subject 51 - Courtroom audio is not working" and "Subject 75 - Courtroom Printer"
need to have Brad and Amber CC'ed on the email alerts.

View Ticket and Close Ticket need to be combined into one page.


Known bugs:

The priority switcher does not record changes if used in ie.

Changing the court case number on the case summary page will cause it's evidence to be orphaned.

Drag and drop file upload on trouble tickets requires a file or the form wont submit.





Possible Improvments:

Check through ci2 and see if there is any code that should make use of events. (Pages 44 - 45)

Add more yii exceptions.

Using Yii::app()->getRequest(), with sendFile(...) for sending files. (Page 66)

Make a Delete, Admin, Index, and View Component for identical delete, admin, index, and view actions
throughout the controllers. (Pages 96 - 98)

Make a Success or Error flash message for all the delete, update, and create actions. (Pages 102 - 103)

Auto updating news widgets without page refresh (Pages 137 - 139)

Custom grid view columns for setting flags (Pages 289 - 294)

Profile the speed performance of pages (Pages 415 - 425)
